        Federal Government. This is the minimum set of rules for US documents to adhere to, and all US documents

        Intelligence Community. Documents that claim compliance with USIC MUST also claim compliance with USGov.

        Department of Defense. Documents that claim compliance with USDOD MUST also claim compliance with USGov.
