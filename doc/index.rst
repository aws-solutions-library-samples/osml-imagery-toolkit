=====================

The OversightML Imagery Toolkit is a Python package that contains image processing and photogrammetry routines commonly
used during the analysis of imagery collected by satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It builds upon GDAL
by providing additional support for images compliant with the National Imagery Transmission Format (NITF), Sensor
Independent Complex Data (SICD), and Sensor Independent Derived Data (SIDD) standards.
